            What does <strong> Envision </strong> do ?
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="Content">
            We are a Non-profit organization that focuses on improving our environment. Our vision is to help our
            surroundings as much as we can, whether it's caring for stray animals, nurturing plants, or making our space
            safe for our loved ones. We believe that by working together, we can make a significant difference in the
            world around us.
            <br>
            <br>
            At Envision, we strive to spread general awareness to all those who visit our page. We provide valuable
            information on various topics such as how to care for stray animals, how to nurture plants, and how to make
            our space safe. Our aim is to educate and empower individuals to take action and contribute to the
            betterment of our environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            As Helen Keller once said, "Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much." We firmly believe in
            the power of collaboration and collective efforts. By coming together, sharing knowledge, and taking
            collective action, we can create a positive impact on our environment and make a lasting change.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want to learn more about our initiatives and how you can get involved, we encourage you to dive into
            Envision's Vision. Together, we can make a significant difference and create a better future for ourselves
            and future generations.

        <div class="Content">
            <br>
            In the hustle and bustle of today's life, we are taking care of ourselves but failing to take care of
            nature. With the help of Envision, you can find out the daily activities that will enable you to take care
            of both yourself and nature.
            <br>
            <br>
            Explaining with an example, let's say you have leftover food from the entire day. Normally, you might just
            throw it away, but Envision will suggest ways in which your food doesn't become extra or go to waste. It
            will recommend giving it to stray animals during the night or inform you about NGOs that you can donate the
            food to.

        <div class="Content">
            <br>
            We strongly encourage everyone to actively participate in eco-friendly campaigns that are organized in their
            respective states and cities. These campaigns provide an excellent opportunity for individuals to directly
            contribute to the betterment of the environment and make a positive impact in their local communities. By
            participating, individuals can engage in activities such as tree planting, beach clean-ups, recycling
            drives, and awareness campaigns.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, we understand that not everyone may be able to participate in these campaigns due to various
            reasons such as time constraints, geographical limitations, or personal commitments. In such cases, we
            strive to provide alternative ways for individuals to contribute to environmental causes.
            <br>
            <br>
            One way we do this is by sharing information about reputable non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are
            actively working to protect and preserve the environment. These NGOs dedicate their resources and efforts
            towards addressing critical environmental issues, such as conservation, wildlife protection, sustainable
            development, and climate change mitigation.
            <br>
            <br>
            By sharing information about these NGOs, we aim to connect individuals who are passionate about
            environmental causes with organizations that align with their values and interests. Supporting these NGOs
            through donations, volunteering, or spreading awareness about their work can make a significant difference
            in the ongoing efforts to protect our planet.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ultimately, our goal is to inspire and empower individuals to take action, whether it's through direct
            participation in local eco-friendly campaigns or supporting environmental NGOs. We believe that collective
            efforts, regardless of scale, have the potential to bring about meaningful change and create a sustainable
            future for generations to come.
